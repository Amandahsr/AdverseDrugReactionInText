on O
the O
contrary O
, O
indomethacin O
, O
a O
specific O
prostaglandin O

inhibitor O
, O
increased O
serum O
levels O

hypophosphataemia O
was O
observed O
only O
after O
the O
administration O

of O
aspirin O
in O

rats O
, O
while O
the O
reduction O

investigated O
in O

rats O
after O
the O
acute O

chronic O
administration O

serum O
levels O

not O
altered O
significantly O
by O
acute O

chronic O
administration O

indomethacin O

a O

indomethacin O
significantly O
reduced O

however O
, O
the O
acute O

aspirin O
resulted O
in O
non-significant O
changes O
in O
serum O

urinary O
concentrations O
of O

these O
data O
suggest O
that O
aspirin O
has O
hypocalcaemic O
and O
hypocalciuric O
actions O
while O
indomethacin O
has O
only O
a O
hypocalciuric O
effect O
. O
aspirin O
may O
produce O
these O
actions O
by O
two O
mechanisms O
, O
one O
of O
them O
like O
that O
of O
indomethacin O
which O
is O
dependent O
on O
the O
inhibition O
of O
biosynthesis O
of O
prostaglandins O
, O
and O
another O
possible O
mechanism O
that O
is O
not O
related O
to O
the O
inhibition O
of O
prostaglandin O
biosynthesis O
. O
this O
suggestion O
may O
be O
supported O
by O
the O
discrepancy O
between O
the O
effects O
of O
aspirin O
and O
indomethacin O
on O
the O

introduction O
: O
scrotal O
lymphedema O
is O
a O
chronic O
lymphatic O
disorder O
characterised O
by O
swelling O
of O
the O
scrotum O
due O
to O
lymphatic O
obstruction O
, O
often O
caused O
by O
filarial O
infection O
, O
malignancy O
, O
or O
inguinal O
surgery O
. O
this O
condition O
can O
lead O
to O
fibrosis O
, O
functional O
impairment O
, O
and O
recurrent O
infections O
. O
treatment O
mainly O
involves O
surgical O
intervention O
. O
the O
presence O
of O
pan-urethral O
warts O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
this O
rare O
case O
, O
complicates O

presentation O
: O
a O
38-year-old O
maasai O
man O
presented O
with O
chronic O
, O
massive O
penoscrotal O
lymphedema O
following O
childhood O
bilateral O
inguinal O
surgery O
. O
he O
developed O
a O
secondary O
infection O
, O
requiring O
surgical O
debridement O
and O
definitive O
scrotoplasty O
. O
histology O
confirmed O
scrotal O
lymphedema O
without O
malignancy O
. O
subsequently O
, O
excision O
of O
elephantoid O
skin O
and O
genital O
reconstruction O
was O
done O
and O
later O
on O
, O
the O
genital O
warts O
were O
excised O
and O
5 O
% O
imiquimod O
cream O
was O
applied O
to O
clear O
the O
lesions O
. O
postoperative O
recovery O
was O
uneventful O
, O
with O
good O
functional O
and O
cosmetic O
outcomes O
maintained O
at O
the O
six-month O
follow-up O
. O
clinical O
discussion O
: O
genital O
lymphedema O
rarely O
occurs O
together O
with O
genital O
warts O
but O
may O
do O
so O
due O
to O
local O
immune O
impairment O
in O
lymphedematous O
skin O
. O
diagnosis O
is O
primarily O
clinical O
, O
with O
histological O
confirmation O
of O
the O
findings O
. O
management O
involves O
surgical O
excision O
. O
delayed O
presentation O
for O
these O
patients O
extends O
the O
treatment O
and O
recovery O
period O
. O
conclusion O
: O
scrotal O
lymphedema O
is O
characterised O
by O
an O
enlargement O
of O
the O
scrotum O
due O
to O
lymphatic O
obstruction O
, O
often O
linked O
to O
filariasis O
or O
surgery O
. O
it O
rarely O
occurs O
with O
genital O
warts O
, O
suggesting O
local O
immune O
compromise O
in O
such O
cases O
and O
requiring O
a O
combined O
approach O
of O
surgical O
and O
medical O
management O

the O
skin O
is O
the O
organ O
most O
often O
affected O
by O
adverse O
drug O
reactions O
. O
although O
these O
cutaneous O
adverse O
drug O
reactions O
( O
cadrs O
) O
often O
are O
mild O
, O
they O
represent O
a O
major O
burden O
for O
patients O
. O
one O
of O
the O
drugs O
inducing O
cadrs O
is O
aldesleukin B-DRUG
, O
a O
recombinant O
interleukin-2 O
( O
recil-2 O
) O
originally O
approved O
to O
treat O
malignant O
melanoma O
and O
metastatic O
renal O
cell O
carcinoma O
which O
frequently O
led O
to O
skin O
rashes O
when O
applied O
in O
high O
doses O
for O
anti-cancer O
therapy O
. O
skin O
rashes O
and O
other O
side O
effects O
, O
together O
with O
poor O
efficacy O
led O
to O
a O
drawback O
of O
the O
therapeutic O
, O
but O
modified O
recil-2 O
molecules O
are O
on O
the O
rise O
to O
treat O
both O
cancer O
and O
inflammatory O
diseases O
such O
as O
autoimmunity O
. O
still O
, O
pathophysiological O
mechanisms O
of O
recil-2-induced O
skin O
rashes O
are O
not O
understood O
. O
in O
the O
study O
reported O
here O
, O
a O
hypothetical O
literature-based O
immune-related O
adverse O
outcome O
pathway O
( O
iraop O
) O
was O
developed O
to O
identify O
possible O
key O
cells O
and O
molecules O
in O
recil-2-induced O
skin O
rash B-ADR
. O
using O
this O
approach O
, O
a O
hypothesis O
was O
formed O
that O
the O
induced O
immune O
response O
predominantly O
is O
type O
2-driven O
by O
t-helper O
and O
innate O
lymphoid O
cells O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
occurrence O
of O
cutaneous O
side O
effects O
during O
recil-2 O
therapy O
. O
this O
paper O
further O
discusses O
mechanisms O
beyond O
the O
proposed O
iraop O
which O
might O
add O
to O
the O
pathology O
but O
currently O
are O
less-studied O
. O
together O
, O
this O
hypothetic O
iraop O
forms O
a O
basis O
to O
clarify O
possible O
cellular O
and O
molecular O
interactions O
leading O
to O
recil-2-induced O
skin O
rash B-ADR
. O
this O
might O
be O
used O
to O
adapt O
existing O
or O
develop O
new O
test O
systems O
to O
help O
predict O
and O

which O
can O
be O
further O
broken O

xenobiotics O
through O
the O

; O
however O
, O
there O
are O
many O

. O
toxicity O
is O
encountered O
in O
various O
populations O
, O
particularly O
in O
children O
and O

, O
due O
to O
the O

to O
examine O
the O
anti-inflammatory O
effects O
of O
amitriptyline O
and O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
it O

. O
our O
research O
revealed O
that O
amitriptyline O
is O
effective O
in O
alleviating O
several O
pathological O

, O
we O
observed O
that O

in O
the O

inhibited O
the O

in O
summary O
, O
our O
findings O

statement O
: O
the O
potential O
of O
using O

a O
5-year-old O
girl O
presented O
with O
a O
facial O

that O
persisted O
for O
5 O
months O
without O
arthralgia O
, O
fever O
, O

, O
photosensitivity O
, O
or O
other O
symptoms O
. O
lupus O
erythematosus O
was O
clinically O
suspected O
. O
all O
blood O
tests O
were O
negative O
or O
within O
normal O

. O
skin O

showed O
a O
dense O
nodular O
superficial O
and O
deep O
inflammatory O
infiltrate O
of O
lymphocytes O
that O
reaches O
subcutaneous O
tissue O
. O
the O
most O
striking O
histopathological O
finding O
was O
plasma O
cells O
with O
some O
perifollicular O
accentuation O
. O
borrelia O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
assay O
of O
the O
tissue O
was O
positive O
, O
and O
we O
made O
the O
diagnoses O
of O
borrelia O
lymphocytoma O
mimicking O
butterfly O
rash O
of O
lupus O
erythematosus O
. O
the O
lesions O
disappeared O
with O
amoxicillin O
followed O
by O
cefuroxime O
for O
28 O
days O
. O
in O
children O
, O
a O
variety O
of O
diseases O
including O
lupus O
erythematous O
may O
lead O
to O
a O
butterfly O
rash O
that O
is O
usually O
short O
lasting O
and O
commonly O
associated O
with O
systemic O
symptoms O
. O
borreliosis O
may O
be O
related O
with O
long-lasting O
facial O
erythema O
in O
children O
and O
may O
mimic O
lupus O
and O
present O
high O
titers O
of O
antinuclear O
antibodies O
. O
in O
any O
case O
, O
borrelial O
lymphocytoma O
has O
not O
been O
previously O
reported O
as O
a O
cause O
of O
butterfly O
rash O
, O
thus O
mimicking O
acute O
lupus O
in O
a O
child O
, O
as O
in O
our O
case. O
from O
a O
histopathological O
point O
of O
view O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
plasma O
cells O
in O
a O
pseudolymphomatous O
infiltrate O
is O
a O
clue O
for O
the O
right O
diagnosis O
. O
therefore O
, O
we O
suggest O
that O
borrelia O
serology O
should O
be O
done O
in O
children O
with O
butterfly O
rash O
lasting O
more O
than O
a O

and O
empirical O
antibiotic O
treatment O
should O
be O
tried O
even O
in O

, O
58 O
months O
after O
completing O

minocycline O
. O
although O
leprosy O
is O
primarily O
observed O
in O
tropical O

, O
the O
long O
incubation O
period O
of O
this O
disease O
combined O
with O
the O
global O
flow O
of O

, O
made O
us O
consider O
it. O
despite O
being O
rare O
, O
leprosy O
relapses O
can O
occur O
even O
after O
a O

decades O
. O
the O
contribution O
of O
rituximab O

one O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
challenges O
for O
any O
prescriber O
is O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
legitimate O
prescription O
of O

substances O
and O
the O
prescription O
that O
may O
be O
used O
for O
illegitimate O
purposes O
. O
to O
discern O
the O
difference O
, O
prescribers O
need O
to O
understand O
the O
signs O
, O
symptoms O
, O
and O

of O
acute O
and O
chronic O
pain O
and O
the O
signs O
and O

of O

misusing O

substances O
. O
pain O
relief O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
reasons O
patients O
seek O
medical O
attention O
. O
although O
many O
categories O
of O
pain O
medications O
are O
available O
, O
opioid O
analgesics O
are O
approved O
by O
the O
food O
and O
drug O
administration O
( O
fda O
) O
for O
moderate-to-severe O
pain O
. O
as O
such O
, O
they O
are O
a O
common O
choice O
for O
patients O
with O
acute O
, O
cancer-related O
, O
neurologic O
, O
and O
end-of-life O
pain O
. O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
for O
chronic O
pain O
is O
controversial O
and O
fraught O
with O
inconclusive O
standards O
. O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
chronic O
failure O
of O
health O
professionals O
to O
treat O
severe O
pain O
appropriately O
led O
to O
an O
expansion O
in O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
. O
unfortunately O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
increased O
overuse O
, O
diversion O
of O
drugs O
, O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
, O
and O
overdose B-ADR
. O
the O
catch-22 O
is O
that O
health O
professionals O
either O
undertreat O
patients O
, O
leading O
to O
unnecessary O
suffering O
, O
or O
overtreat O
them O
, O
which O
can O
cause O
adverse O
effects O
such O
as O
increased O
risk O
of O
opioid O
analgesic O
use O
disorder O
and O
potential O
overdose B-ADR
. O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
reached O
its O
highest O
point O
in O
2011 O
. O
since O
then O
, O
both O
prescribing O
and O
overdose B-ADR
have O
been O
declining O
. O
however O
, O
as O
a O
society O
, O
in O
both O
the O
lay O
and O
scientific O
literature O
, O
there O
are O
significant O
concerns O
that O
we O
are O
still O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
opioid O
crisis O
. O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
challenges O
in O
caring O
for O
patients O
with O
pain O
is O
their O
varying O
tolerance O
levels O
, O
which O
necessitate O
different O
opioid O
doses O
to O
achieve O
adequate O
pain O
relief O
. O
patients O
may O
exhibit O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
behavioral O
, O
cultural O
, O
emotional O
, O
and O
psychological O
responses O
to O
pain O
compared O
to O
those O
with O
a O
substance O

; O
often O
, O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
two O
can O
be O
challenging O
. O
all O
healthcare O
professionals O
engaged O
in O
pain O
control O
need O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
treatment O
recommendations O
and O
safety O
concerns O
in O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
. O
appropriate O
opioid O
prescribing O
requires O
a O
thorough O
patient O
assessment O
, O
short O

and O
long-term O
treatment O
planning O
, O
close O
follow-up O
, O
and O

all O

need O
to O

, O
and O
the O
potential O
for O

, O
and O
hazardous O
behavioral O
responses O
to O

substances O
, O
such O
as O

, O
which O
differ O
from O
pseudoaddiction O
and O
physical O
dependence O
. O
many O
clinicians O
have O
limited O
knowledge O
of O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
. O
they O
often O
fail O
to O
recognize O
it O
as O
a O
disease O
and O
mistakenly O
believe O
that O
opioid O
dependence O
is O
the O
same O
as O

. O
a O
lack O
of O
clear O
understanding O
can O
lead O
to O
confusion O
between O
patients O
with O
chronic O
non-use O
disorder O
and O
those O
misusing O
their O
prescribed O
opioids O
. O
a O
lack O
of O

the O

the O

question O

, O
" O
what O
is O

optimal O

for O
a O

patient O
?" O
this O
question O
can O
be O
addressed O
only O

considers O

cause O
of O

, O
its O

mcgoldrick O
and O
bailie O
concluded O
on O
an O
economic O
basis O
that O
acetaminophen O
is O
the O
analgesic O
of O
choice O
for O
most O
patients O
, O
including O
those O
with O
impaired O
renal O
function O
. O
this O
recommendation O
is O
in O
agreement O
with O
those O
of O
the O
analgesics O
and O
the O
kidney O
ad O
hoc O
committee O
of O
the O
national O
kidney O
foundation O
. O
it O
also O
would O
seem O
prudent O
to O
use O
acetaminophen O
as O
the O
first-line O
agent O
for O
those O
patients O
in O
whom O
aspirin O
and O
nsaid O
use O
should O
be O
avoided O
or O
used O
only O
with O
caution O
along O
with O
frequent O
monitoring O
of O
renal O
function O
, O
blood O
pressure O
, O
electrolytes O
, O
and O
/ O
or O
coagulation O
status O
. O
thus O
, O
there O
is O
little O
to O
no O
controversy O
in O
their O
recommendation O
to O
initiate O
treatment O
with O
acetaminophen O
. O
the O
authors O
, O
however O
, O
also O
suggested O
that O
switching O
patients O
from O
an O
nsaid O
to O
acetaminophen O
would O
result O
in O
significantly O
decreased O
costs O
and O
morbidity O
. O
these O
authors O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
address O
one O
key O
issue O
that O
impacts O
their O
economic O
analysis O
: O
the O
relative O
efficacy O
of O
acetaminophen O
and O
nsaids O
. O
if O
efficacy O
is O
similar O
, O
then O
the O
risk O
/ O
benefit O
ratio O
and O
economic O
consequences O
would O
favor O
the O
use O
of O
acetaminophen O
. O
however O
, O
if O
many O
patients O
are O
receiving O
nsaids O
because O
they O
did O
not O
obtain O
pain O
relief O
with O
the O
use O
of O
acetaminophen O
, O
there O
would O
be O
neither O
rationale O
or O
likely O
benefit O
with O
a O
change O
in O
therapy O
to O
acetaminophen O
. O
finally O
, O
mcgoldrick O
and O
bailie O
did O
not O
evaluate O
an O
issue O
that O
has O
perhaps O
the O
most O
far-reaching O
consequence O
. O
many O
otc O
analgesics O
are O
currently O
marketed O
as O
combinations O
of O
aspirin O
, O
acetaminophen O
, O
salicylamide O
, O
or O
caffeine O
( O
table O

) O
. O
although O
the O
intent O
of O
these O
combinations O
was O
[ O
table O
: O
see O
text O
] O
to O
enhance O
efficacy O
while O
minimizing O
adverse O
events O
, O
it O
is O
now O
apparent O
that O
at O
least O
concerning O
adverse O
events O
, O
the O
goal O
was O
not O
achieved O
. O
therefore O
, O
in O
light O
of O
the O
markedly O
higher O
risk O
for O
renal O
injury O
with O
combination O
analgesics O
, O
these O
agents O
should O
be O
withdrawn O
from O
the O
marketplace O
. O
while O
some O
might O
argue O
that O
patient O
education O
is O
the O
key O
and O
that O
addition O
of O
an O
explicit O
warning O
on O
the O
label O
of O
otc O
combination O
products O
should O
be O
an O
adequate O
intervention O
, O
this O
agreement O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
the O
belgium O
experience O
. O
the O
removal O
of O
combination O
analgesics O
from O
the O
otc O
marketplace O
could O
be O
accomplished O
by O
governmental O
action O
, O
such O
as O
the O
ban O
on O
phenacetin O
over O
10 O
years O
ago O
. O
alternatively O
, O

no O

these O

counsel O
patients O
on O
the O
rational O
use O
of O

the O

be O

system O
( O

) O
that O
affects O
more O
than O
2.5 O
million O

. O
remyelination O
represents O
a O

; O
however O
, O
during O

why O
does O
remyelination O
fail O
in O
ms O
? O
platelets O
are O
small O
, O
oval O
, O
anucleate O
cells O
that O
circulate O
in O
the O

and O
form O
a O
hemostatic O

to O

upon O

. O
platelet O
function O
is O
not O
restricted O
to O
hemostasis O
; O
they O
also O
display O
tissue-regenerative O
activities O
. O
here O
, O
we O
review O
evidence O
suggesting O
that O
platelets O
act O
as O
modulators O
of O
opc O
function O
during O
remyelination O
. O
additionally O
, O
we O
describe O
platelet O
alterations O
associated O
with O
ms O
that O
may O
contribute O
to O
remyelination O
failure O
. O
finally O
, O
we O
highlighted O
our O
previous O
study O
that O
addressed O
these O
issues O
. O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
in O
response O
to O
myelin O
damage O
, O
platelets O
transiently O
accumulate O
within O
the O
lesion O
. O
interestingly O
, O
platelet O
depletion O
leads O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O
opc O
differentiation O
, O
hindering O
remyelination O
. O
in O

studies O
revealed O
that O
transient O
exposure O
to O
platelets O
boosts O
opc O
differentiation O
, O
whereas O
sustained O
exposure O
to O
platelets O
suppresses O
this O
beneficial O
effect O
. O
consistent O
with O
this O
observation O
, O
in O
an O
in O

model O
of O
thrombocytosis O
( O
calr O
+/-) O
, O
we O
found O
a O
sustained O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
blood-borne O
platelets O
recruited O
into O
the O
cns O
( O

) O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
significant O

introduction O
: O
we O
report O
the O
case O
of O
a O
multiple O
drug O
interaction O
involving O
clozapine O
, O
antifungals O
and O
oral O
contraceptives O
, O
which O
resulted O
in O
an O
increased O
clozapine O
plasma O
level O
, O
pericarditis O
with O
pericardial O
effusion O
and O
eosinophilia O
in O
a O
young O
caucasian O
woman O
. O
these O
symptoms O
and O
signs O
disappeared O
a O
few O
days O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
clozapine O
. O
at O
present O
, O
we O
are O
not O
aware O
of O
reports O
of O
clozapine-antifungals O

, O
whereas O
there O
is O
only O
one O
other O
case O
report O
on O
the O
interaction O
between O
oral O
contraceptives O
and O
clozapine O
. O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
case O
report O
is O
to O
show O
the O
risk O
of O
potentially O
serious O
adverse O
effects O
stemming O
from O
drug O
interactions O
involving O
medications O
routinely O
used O
in O

. O
case O
presentation O
: O
a O
29-year-old O
caucasian O
woman O
diagnosed O
with O
a O
schizoaffective O
disorder O
was O
admitted O
to O
a O
psychiatric O
unit O
for O
acute O
psychosis O
( O
hallucinations O
, O
delusions O
and O
catatonic O
behavior O
) O
. O
she O
denied O
smoking O
tobacco O
products O
and O
was O
on O
long-term O
oral O
contraceptives O
. O
during O
the O
first O
month O
of O
hospitalization O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
antipsychotics O
and O
for O
1 O
week O
she O
took O
simultaneously O
fluconazole O
and O
miconazole O
gel O
, O
after O
being O
diagnosed O
with O
oral O
candidiasis O
. O
on O
the O
last O
day O
of O
antifungals O
treatment O
, O
29 O
days O
after O
admission O
, O
clozapine O
was O
started O
with O
resolution O
of O
psychotic O
symptoms O
. O
after O
3 O
weeks O
, O
her O
clozapine O
plasma O
level O
had O
increased O
to O
542 O
ng O
/ O
ml O
and O
eosinophilia O
was O
observed O
. O
she O
complained O
of O
nausea O
, O
vomiting B-ADR
and O
palpitations O
; O
echocardiography O
showed O
echocardiographic O
abnormalities O
and O
pericardial O
effusion O
. O
oral O
contraceptives O
were O
discontinued O
and O
after O
1 O
week O
clozapine O
was O
interrupted O
, O
with O
a O
complete O
resolution O
of O
side O
effects O
and O
pericardial O
effusion O
within O
4 O
days O
. O
conclusions O
: O
clozapine O
is O
metabolized O
by O
cytochrome O
p450 O
. O
the O
use O
of O
inhibitors O
or O
other O
substrates O
of O
cytochrome O
p450 O
, O
such O
as O
antifungals O
and O
oral O
contraceptives O
, O
can O
cause O
long-lasting O
interactions O
and O
clozapine O
toxicity O
. O
the O
naranjo O
algorithm O
shows O
clozapine O
is O
a O
definite O
cause O
of O
pericarditis O
( O
score O
9 O
) O
and O
both O
clozapine-antifungals O
and O
clozapine-contraceptives O
interactions O
resulted O
probable O
( O
score O

knowledge O
on O
drugs O
that O
act O
as O
substrates O
, O
inhibitors O
or O
inducers O
of O
cytochrome O
p450 O
is O
mandatory O
. O
when O
those O
drugs O
are O
used O
in O
patients O
taking O
clozapine O
, O
blood O
level O
monitoring O
of O
clozapine O
should O
be O
recommended O
, O
since O
a O

introduction O
since O
the O
last O
edition O
of O
the O
black O
book O
, O
several O
innovative O
agents O
have O
been O
approved O
or O
are O
poised O
to O
be O
approved O
in O
the O
coming O
year O
. O
these O
include O
novel O
antidepressants O
, O
the O
first O
muscarine O
agonist O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
schizophrenia O
, O
the O
first O
psychedelic O
which O
may O
be O
approved O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
ptsd O
( O
post O
traumatic O
stress O
disorder O
) O
, O
and O
the O
first O
disease O
modifying O
drug O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
alzheimer O
's O
disease O
. O
three O
new O
antidepressants O
have O
come O
to O
the O
market O
in O
the O
past O
18 O
months O
. O
the O
first O
of O
those O
, O
auvelity O
, O
the O
combination O
of O
bupropion O
and O
dextromethorphan O
, O
takes O
advantage O
of O
a O
pharmacokinetic O
and O
pharmacodynamic O
synergism O
between O
the O
two O
drugs.85 O
dextromethorphan O
has O
several O
pharmacodynamic O
properties O
including O
actions O
on O
the O
nmda O
receptor O
and O
the O
sigma O
1 O
receptor O
, O
adding O
to O
the O
indirect O
norepinephrine O
agonist O
properties O
of O
bupropion O
. O
how O
dextromethorphan O
is O
rapidly O
metabolized O
via O
the O
cyp2d6 O
isoenzyme O
to O
dextrophan O
that O
may O
have O
mu O
opioid O
agonist O
properties O
. O
the O
combination O
with O
bupropion O
, O
a O
cyp2d6 O
inhibitor O
, O
inhibits O
the O
metabolism O
of O
dextromethorphan O
allowing O
for O
more O
consistent O
therapeutic O
levels O
. O
the O
combination O
of O
dextromethorphan O
45 O
mg O
twice O
per O
day O
and O
bupropion O
sr O
105 O
mg O
twice O
daily O
appears O
to O
be O
more O
effective O
than O
an O
equivalent O
dose O
of O
bupropion O
alone O
both O
in O
speeding O
up O
antidepressant O
response O
and O
achieving O
remission O
. O
however O
, O
it O
's O
not O
clear O
at O
this O
time O
how O
the O
combination O
would O
compare O
with O
a O
more O
typical O
dose O
of O
bupropion O
of O
300-450 O
milligrams O
a O
day O
range O
. O
the O
phase O
iii O
program O
for O
auvelity O
, O
showed O
that O
the O
drug O
was O
well O
tolerated O
with O
the O
most O
common O
side O
effects O
being O
dizziness O
, O
headache O
, O
and O
dry O
mouth.86 O
another O
novel O
antidepressant O
agent O
approved O
in O
2023 O
is O
zuranolone O
( O
zurzuvae O
) O
. O
zuranolone O
is O
an O
oral O
analog O
of O
iv O
brexanalone O
, O
and O
like O
brexanolone O
, O
was O
approved O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
post-partum O
depression.83 O
the O
advantages O
of O
zuranolone O
over O
brexanalone O
are O
many O
. O
while O
brexanolone O
is O
a O
60-hour O
intravenous O
infusion O
that O
must O
be O
administered O
in O
a O
health O
care O
facility O
, O
zuranolone O
is O
a O
once O
/ O
day O
oral O
medication O
that O
is O
usually O
taken O
at O
home O
. O
like O
brexanolone O
, O
and O
unlike O
most O
antidepressants O
, O
zuranolone O
has O
a O
short O
course O
of O
treatment O
, O
lasting O
just O
14 O
days O
. O
zuranolone O
's O
, O
as O
does O
brexanolone O
, O
is O
thought O
to O
act O
primarily O
as O
allosteric O
modulator O
of O
the O
gaba-a O
receptors O
. O
despite O
only O
14 O
days O
of O
treatment O
, O
zuranolone O
produced O
in O
depression O
in O
post-partum O
patients O
a O
clinically O
and O
significantly O
meaningful O
improvement O
at O
day O
15 O
and O
continued O
to O
day O
45 O
or O
1 O
month O
past O
the O
end O
of O
treatment O
. O
zuranolone O
is O
a O
schedule O
iv O
drug O
. O
the O
most O
common O
side O
effect O
in O
clinical O
trials O
was O
somnolence O
with O
36 O
% O
of O
participants O
reporting O
this O
side O
effect O
vs O
only O
6 O
% O
of O
those O
on O
placebo.84 O
other O
common O
side O
effects O
included O
dizziness O
, O
diarrhea O
and O
fatigue O
. O
while O
the O
fda O
declined O
to O
approve O
zuranolone O
as O
monotherapy O
or O
as O
an O
adjunctive O
treatment O
to O
standard O
antidepressants O
in O
major O
depression O
itself O
, O
there O
are O
positive O
studies O
in O
non-post-partum O
major O
depression O
albeit O
with O
smaller O
effect O
sizes O
and O
less O
consistent O
duration O
of O
activity O
. O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
zuranolone O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
studied O
in O
other O
depressive O
syndromes O
such O
as O
depression O
with O
anxious O
distress O
. O
the O
third O
" O
new O
" O
antidepressant O
approved O
late O
2023 O
was O
gepirone O
( O
exxua O
) O
. O
gepirone O
is O
not O
exactly O
a O
new O
or O
novel O
antidepressant O
and O
originally O
sought O
approval O
in O
the O
us O
about O
20 O
years O
ago.88 O
there O
had O
been O
two O
positive O
studies O
of O
gepirone O
during O
the O
original O
nda O
application O
but O
also O
a O
number O
of O
failed O
, O
negative O
, O
or O
non-informative O
studies O
as O
well O
. O
thus O
, O
the O
fda O
declined O
to O
originally O
approve O
the O
drug O
. O
however O
, O
failed O
and O
negative O
trials O
are O
common O
with O
antidepressants O
and O
after O
much O
internal O
debate O
, O
the O
fda O
ultimately O
agreed O
to O
approve O
the O
drug O
based O
on O
the O
positive O
trials O
and O
a O
relatively O
favorable O
side O
effect O
profile O
. O
gepirone O
, O
like O
buspirone O
, O
is O
a O
partial O
agonist O
of O
the O
5ht1a O
receptor O
and O
a O
5ht2 O
antagonist O
. O
as O
such O
, O
gepirone O
does O
not O
tend O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
sexual O
side O
effects O
, O
weight O
gain O
, O
or O
sedation B-ADR
. O
the O
most O
common O
side O
effects O
are O
dizziness O
, O
nausea O
, O
and O
insomnia O
which O
tend O
to O
improve O
in O
many O
patients O
over O
time O
. O
second O
generation O
antipsychotics O
( O
sgas O
) O
continue O
to O
be O
the O
only O
class O
of O
agents O
[ O
other O
than O
esketamine O
( O
spravato O
)] O
approved O
in O
adjunctive O
treatment O
of O
resistant O
major O
depression O
. O
in O
addition O
to O
olanzapine O
( O
combined O
with O
fluoxetine O
; O
symbyax O
) O
, O
aripiprazole O
( O
abilify O
) O
, O
quetiapine O
( O
seroquel O
) O
, O
brexpiprazole O
( O
rexulti O
) O
, O
cariprazine O
( O
vraylar O
) O
became O
the O
latest O
sga O
to O
be O
approved O
in O
2022.90 O
adjunctive O
cariprazine O
at O
1.5 O
mg O
daily O
was O
significantly O
more O
effective O
than O
adjunctive O
placebo O
in O
patients O
with O
mdd O
who O
had O
failed O
to O
achieve O
an O
adequate O
response O
with O
an O
antidepressant O
alone O
after O
6 O
weeks O
of O
treatment O
. O
interestingly O
, O
a O
3 O
mg O
dose O
of O
cariprazine O
was O
less O
consistently O
effective.91 O
the O
major O
advantage O
of O
cariprazine O
over O
some O
of O
the O
other O
approved O
adjunctive O
sga O
's O
is O
easy O
dosing O
, O
with O
the O
starting O
1.5 O
mg O
dose O
being O
the O
optimal O
therapeutic O
dose O
for O
most O
people O
, O
and O
a O
lower O
metabolic O
side O
effect O
burden O
with O
most O
subjects O
having O
limited O
or O
no O
weight O
gain O
in O
short O
term O
trials O
. O
the O
most O
common O
side O
effect O
were O
akathisia O
/ O
restlessness O
, O
fatigue O
, O
and O
nausea O
. O
lumateperone O
( O

treatment O
of O
major O
depression O
and O
is O
expective O
file O
for O

in O
late O
2024 O
. O
another O
recent O
major O
development O
in O
psychopharmacology O
is O
the O
reemergence O
of O
psychedelics O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O

of O
these O

she O
was O
in O
her O

this O
was O
the O

alone O
both O
in O

. O
however O
, O
it O

not O
clear O
at O

how O
the O

would O
compare O
with O

thus O
, O
the O

however O
, O

are O
common O
with O

after O
much O
internal O

, O
the O
fda O
ultimately O
agreed O
to O
approve O
the O
drug O
based O
on O
the O
positive O
trials O

relatively O
favorable O

pointed O

virtually O
all O

guess O
whether O
they O
got O
the O

. O
the O
functional O

, O
the O
lack O
of O

of O

as O
well O
as O
the O

of O
mdma O
, O
may O
delay O
an O

. O
the O
typical O

the O

thus O
, O

much O
higher O

since O

an O

be O
made O
that O

the O

background O
: O
coenzyme O
q O
( O
coq O
) O
is O
an O
enzyme O
family O
that O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
maintaining O
the O
electron O
transport O
chain O
and O
antioxidant O
defense O
. O
coq10 O
is O
the O
most O
common O
form O
of O
coq O
in O
humans O
. O
a O
deficiency O
of O
coq10 O
occurs O
naturally O
with O
aging O
and O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
or O
progression O
of O
many O
diseases O
. O
besides O
, O
certain O
drugs O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
statins O
and O
bisphosphonates O
, O
interfere O
with O
the O
enzymes O
responsible O
for O
coq10 O
biosynthesis O
and O
, O
thus O
, O
lead O
to O
coq10 O
deficiency O
. O
objectives O
: O
this O
article O
aims O
to O
evaluate O
the O
cumulative O
studies O
and O
insights O
on O
the O
topic O
of O
coq10 O
functions O
in O
human O
health O
, O
focusing O
on O
a O
potential O
role O
in O
maintaining O
physical O
activity O
and O
extending O
the O
life O
cycle O
. O
results O
: O
although O
supplementation O
with O
coq10 O
offers O
many O
benefits O
to O
patients O
with O
cardiovascular O
disease O
, O
it O
appears O
to O
add O
little O
value O
to O
patients O
suffering O
from O
statin-associated O
muscular O
symptoms O
. O
this O
may O
be O
attributed O
to O
substantial O
heterogeneity O
in O
doses O
and O
treatment O
regimens O
used O
. O
conclusion O
: O
therefore O
, O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
further O
studies O
involving O
a O
greater O
number O
of O
patients O
to O
clarify O
the O
benefits O
of O
adjuvant O
therapy O
with O
coq10 O
in O
a O
range O
of O
health O
conditions O
and O
diseases O

one O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
challenges O
for O
any O
prescriber O
is O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
legitimate O
prescription O
of O
controlled O
substances O
and O
the O
prescription O
that O
may O
be O
used O
for O
illegitimate O
purposes O
. O
to O
discern O
the O
difference O
, O
prescribers O
need O
to O
understand O
the O
signs O
, O
symptoms O
, O
and O
treatment O
of O
acute O
and O
chronic O
pain O
and O
the O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
of O
patients O
misusing O
controlled O
substances O
. O
pain O
relief O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
reasons O
patients O
seek O
medical O
attention O
. O
although O
many O
categories O
of O
pain O
medications O
are O
available O
, O
opioid O
analgesics O
are O
approved O
by O
the O
food O
and O
drug O
administration O
( O
fda O
) O
for O
moderate-to-severe O
pain O
. O
as O
such O
, O
they O
are O
a O
common O
choice O
for O
patients O
with O
acute O
, O
cancer-related O
, O
neurologic O
, O
and O
end-of-life O
pain O
. O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
for O
chronic O
pain O
is O
controversial O
and O
fraught O
with O
inconclusive O
standards O
. O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
chronic O
failure O
of O
health O
professionals O
to O
treat O
severe O
pain O
appropriately O
led O
to O
an O
expansion O
in O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
. O
unfortunately O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
increased O
overuse O
, O
diversion O
of O
drugs O
, O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
, O
and O
overdose O
. O
the O
catch-22 O
is O
that O
health O
professionals O
either O
undertreat O
patients O
, O
leading O
to O
unnecessary O
suffering O
, O
or O
overtreat O
them O
, O
which O
can O
cause O
adverse O
effects O
such O
as O
increased O
risk O
of O
opioid O
analgesic O
use O
disorder O
and O
potential O
overdose O
. O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
reached O
its O
highest O
point O
in O
2011 O
. O
since O
then O
, O
both O
prescribing O
and O
overdose O
have O
been O
declining O
. O
however O
, O
as O
a O
society O
, O
in O
both O
the O
lay O
and O
scientific O
literature O
, O
there O
are O
significant O
concerns O
that O
we O
are O
still O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
opioid O
crisis O
. O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
challenges O
in O
caring O
for O
patients O
with O
pain O
is O
their O
varying O
tolerance O
levels O
, O
which O
necessitate O
different O
opioid O
doses O
to O
achieve O
adequate O
pain O
relief O
. O
patients O
may O
exhibit O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
behavioral O
, O
cultural O
, O
emotional O
, O
and O
psychological O
responses O
to O
pain O
compared O
to O
those O
with O
a O
substance O
use O
disorder O
; O
often O
, O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
two O
can O
be O
challenging O
. O
all O
healthcare O
professionals O
engaged O
in O
pain O
control O
need O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
treatment O
recommendations O
and O
safety O
concerns O
in O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
. O
appropriate O
opioid O
prescribing O
requires O
a O
thorough O
patient O
assessment O
, O
short O
- O
and O
long-term O
treatment O
planning O
, O
close O
follow-up O

one O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
challenges O
for O
any O
prescriber O
is O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
legitimate O
prescription O
of O
controlled O
substances O
and O
the O
prescription O
that O
may O
be O
used O
for O
illegitimate O
purposes O
. O
to O
discern O
the O
difference O
, O
prescribers O
need O
to O
understand O
the O
signs O
, O
symptoms O
, O
and O
treatment O
of O
acute O
and O
chronic O
pain O
and O
the O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
of O
patients O
misusing O
controlled O
substances O
. O
pain O
relief O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
reasons O
patients O
seek O
medical O
attention O
. O
although O
many O
categories O
of O
pain O
medications O
are O
available O
, O
opioid O
analgesics O
are O
approved O
by O
the O
food O
and O
drug O
administration O
( O
fda O
) O
for O
moderate-to-severe O
pain O
. O
as O
such O
, O
they O
are O
a O
common O
choice O
for O
patients O
with O
acute O
, O
cancer-related O
, O
neurologic O
, O
and O
end-of-life O
pain O
. O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
for O
chronic O
pain O
is O
controversial O
and O
fraught O
with O
inconclusive O
standards O
. O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
chronic O
failure O
of O
health O
professionals O
to O
treat O
severe O
pain O
appropriately O
led O
to O
an O
expansion O
in O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
. O
unfortunately O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
increased O
overuse O
, O
diversion O
of O
drugs O
, O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
, O
and O
overdose O
. O
the O
catch-22 O
is O
that O
health O
professionals O
either O
undertreat O
patients O
, O
leading O
to O
unnecessary O
suffering O
, O
or O
overtreat O
them O
, O
which O
can O
cause O
adverse O
effects O
such O
as O
increased O
risk O
of O
opioid O
analgesic O
use O
disorder O
and O
potential O
overdose O
. O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
reached O
its O
highest O
point O
in O
2011 O
. O
since O
then O
, O
both O
prescribing O
and O
overdose O
have O
been O
declining O
. O
however O
, O
as O
a O
society O
, O
in O
both O
the O
lay O
and O
scientific O
literature O
, O
there O
are O
significant O
concerns O
that O
we O
are O
still O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
opioid O
crisis O
. O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
challenges O
in O
caring O
for O
patients O
with O
pain O
is O
their O
varying O
tolerance O
levels O
, O
which O
necessitate O
different O
opioid O
doses O
to O
achieve O
adequate O
pain O
relief O
. O
patients O
may O
exhibit O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
behavioral O
, O
cultural O
, O
emotional O
, O
and O
psychological O
responses O
to O
pain O
compared O
to O
those O
with O
a O
substance O
use O
disorder O
; O
often O
, O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
two O
can O
be O
challenging O
. O
all O
healthcare O
professionals O
engaged O
in O
pain O
control O
need O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
treatment O
recommendations O
and O
safety O
concerns O
in O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
. O
appropriate O
opioid O
prescribing O
requires O
a O
thorough O
patient O
assessment O
, O
short O
- O
and O
long-term O
treatment O
planning O
, O
close O
follow-up O
, O
and O
continued O
monitoring O
. O
all O
healthcare O
providers O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
of O

patient O
assessment O
, O
treatment O
planning O
, O
and O
the O
potential O
for O
substance O

diversion O
, O
and O
hazardous O
behavioral O
responses O
to O
controlled O
substances O
, O
such O
as O
opioid O
analgesics O
, O
which O
differ O
from O
pseudoaddiction O
and O
physical O
dependence O
. O
many O
clinicians O
have O
limited O
knowledge O
of O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
. O
they O
often O
fail O
to O
recognize O
it O
as O
a O
disease O
and O
mistakenly O
believe O
that O
opioid O
dependence O
is O
the O
same O
as O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
. O
a O
lack O
of O
clear O
understanding O
can O
lead O
to O
confusion O
between O
patients O
with O
chronic O
non-use O
disorder O
and O
those O
misusing O
their O
prescribed O
opioids O
. O
a O
lack O
of O
training O
and O
educational O
deficits O
often O
interfere O
with O
the O
appropriate O

agents O
. O
to O
prevent O
the O
misuse O
of O
