the O

additionally O
, O
exposure O

such O

( O

. O
one O

is O
to O
use O
artificial O

to O
identify O

this O

. O
these O
suggest O
that O
any O

should O
consider O
both O

one O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
challenges O
for O
any O
prescriber O
is O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
legitimate O
prescription O
of O
controlled O
substances O
and O
the O
prescription O
that O
may O
be O
used O
for O
illegitimate O
purposes O
. O
to O
discern O
the O
difference O
, O
prescribers O
need O
to O
understand O
the O
signs O
, O
symptoms O
, O
and O
treatment O
of O
acute O
and O
chronic O
pain O
and O
the O
signs O
and O

of O
patients O
misusing O

substances O
. O
pain O
relief O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
reasons O
patients O
seek O
medical O
attention O
. O
although O
many O
categories O
of O
pain O
medications O
are O
available O
, O
opioid O
analgesics O
are O
approved O
by O
the O
food O
and O
drug O
administration O
( O
fda O
) O
for O
moderate-to-severe O
pain O
. O
as O
such O
, O
they O
are O
a O
common O
choice O
for O
patients O
with O
acute O
, O
cancer-related O
, O
neurologic O
, O
and O
end-of-life O
pain O
. O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
for O
chronic O
pain O
is O
controversial O
and O
fraught O
with O
inconclusive O
standards O
. O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
chronic O
failure O
of O
health O
professionals O
to O
treat O
severe O
pain O
appropriately O
led O
to O
an O
expansion O
in O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
. O
unfortunately O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
increased O
overuse O
, O
diversion O
of O
drugs O
, O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
, O
and O
overdose B-ADR
. O
the O
catch-22 O
is O
that O
health O
professionals O
either O
undertreat O
patients O
, O
leading O
to O
unnecessary O
suffering O
, O
or O
overtreat O
them O
, O
which O
can O
cause O
adverse O
effects O
such O
as O
increased O
risk O
of O
opioid O
analgesic O
use O
disorder O
and O
potential O
overdose B-ADR
. O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
reached O
its O
highest O
point O
in O
2011 O
. O
since O
then O
, O
both O
prescribing O
and O
overdose B-ADR
have O
been O
declining O
. O
however O
, O
as O
a O
society O
, O
in O
both O
the O
lay O
and O
scientific O
literature O
, O
there O
are O
significant O
concerns O
that O
we O
are O
still O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
opioid O
crisis O
. O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
challenges O
in O
caring O
for O
patients O
with O
pain O
is O
their O
varying O
tolerance O
levels O
, O
which O
necessitate O
different O
opioid O
doses O
to O
achieve O
adequate O
pain O
relief O
. O
patients O
may O
exhibit O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
behavioral O
, O
cultural O
, O
emotional O
, O
and O
psychological O
responses O
to O
pain O
compared O
to O
those O
with O
a O
substance O
use O

; O
often O
, O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
two O
can O
be O
challenging O
. O
all O
healthcare O
professionals O
engaged O
in O
pain O
control O
need O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
treatment O
recommendations O
and O
safety O
concerns O
in O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
. O
appropriate O
opioid O
prescribing O
requires O
a O
thorough O
patient O
assessment O
, O
short O
- O
and O
long-term O
treatment O
planning O
, O
close O
follow-up O
, O
and O
continued O
monitoring O
. O
all O
healthcare O
providers O
need O
to O
be O
aware O

, O

, O
and O
the O
potential O
for O
substance O

, O
and O
hazardous O
behavioral O
responses O
to O
controlled O
substances O
, O
such O
as O

analgesics O
, O
which O
differ O
from O
pseudoaddiction O
and O
physical O
dependence O
. O
many O
clinicians O
have O
limited O
knowledge O
of O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
. O
they O
often O
fail O
to O
recognize O
it O
as O
a O
disease O
and O
mistakenly O
believe O
that O
opioid O
dependence O
is O
the O
same O
as O
opioid O
use O

. O
a O
lack O
of O
clear O
understanding O
can O
lead O
to O
confusion O
between O
patients O
with O
chronic O
non-use O
disorder O
and O
those O
misusing O
their O
prescribed O
opioids O
. O
a O
lack O
of O

and O

deficits O
often O
interfere O
with O

the O

the O

the O
economics O
of O
the O
adverse O

use O
proposed O
by O
these O

is O
limited O
by O
the O
fact O
that O

have O
combined O

a O

the O

however O
, O
it O

authoritatively O
that O
the O
relative O
costs O

the O
three O

not O

the O

question O
is O
, O
" O
what O
is O
the O
optimal O

for O
a O

?" O
this O
question O
can O
be O

mcgoldrick O

on O
an O
economic O

that O

the O

of O

. O
it O
also O
would O
seem O
prudent O
to O
use O
acetaminophen O
as O
the O
first-line O
agent O
for O
those O
patients O
in O
whom O
aspirin O

use O
should O
be O
avoided O

thus O
, O
there O
is O
little O
to O
no O
controversy O
in O
their O
recommendation O
to O
initiate O
treatment O
with O
acetaminophen O
. O
the O
authors O
, O
however O
, O
also O
suggested O
that O
switching O
patients O
from O
an O
nsaid O
to O
acetaminophen O
would O
result O
in O
significantly O
decreased O
costs O
and O
morbidity O
. O
these O
authors O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
address O
one O
key O
issue O
that O
impacts O
their O
economic O
analysis O
: O
the O
relative O
efficacy O
of O
acetaminophen O
and O
nsaids O
. O
if O
efficacy O
is O
similar O
, O
then O
the O
risk O
/ O
benefit O
ratio O
and O
economic O
consequences O
would O
favor O
the O
use O
of O
acetaminophen O
. O
however O
, O
if O
many O
patients O
are O
receiving O
nsaids O
because O
they O
did O
not O
obtain O
pain O
relief O
with O
the O
use O

, O
there O
would O
be O
neither O
rationale O
or O
likely O
benefit O
with O
a O
change O
in O
therapy O
to O
acetaminophen O
. O
finally O
, O
mcgoldrick O
and O
bailie O
did O
not O
evaluate O
an O
issue O
that O
has O
perhaps O
the O
most O
far-reaching O
consequence O
. O
many O
otc O
analgesics O
are O
currently O
marketed O
as O
combinations O
of O
aspirin O
, O
acetaminophen O
, O
salicylamide O
, O
or O
caffeine O
( O

) O
. O
although O
the O
intent O
of O
these O
combinations O
was O
[ O
table O
: O
see O
text O
] O
to O
enhance O
efficacy O
while O
minimizing O
adverse O
events O
, O
it O
is O
now O
apparent O
that O
at O
least O
concerning O
adverse O
events O
, O
the O
goal O
was O
not O
achieved O
. O
therefore O
, O
in O
light O
of O
the O
markedly O
higher O
risk O
for O
renal O
injury O
with O
combination O
analgesics O
, O
these O
agents O
should O
be O
withdrawn O
from O
the O
marketplace O
. O
while O
some O
might O
argue O
that O
patient O
education O
is O
the O
key O
and O
that O
addition O
of O
an O
explicit O
warning O
on O
the O
label O
of O
otc O
combination O
products O
should O
be O
an O
adequate O
intervention O
, O
this O
agreement O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
the O
belgium O
experience O
. O
the O
removal O
of O
combination O
analgesics O
from O
the O
otc O
marketplace O
could O
be O
accomplished O
by O
governmental O
action O
, O
such O
as O
the O
ban O

10 O

. O

no O

on O
the O
rational O

is O
an O
autoimmune O

demyelinating O
disease O
of O

central O

system O
( O
cns O
) O
that O
affects O
more O
than O
2.5 O
million O
people O
worldwide O
. O
remyelination O
represents O
a O
robust O
regenerative O
response O
to O

; O
however O
, O
during O
the O
later O

of O

, O
this O

why O
does O
remyelination O
fail O
in O
ms O
? O
platelets O
are O
small O
, O
oval O
, O
anucleate O
cells O
that O
circulate O
in O
the O
bloodstream O
and O
form O
a O
hemostatic O
plug O
to O
stop O

leakage O
upon O

damage O
. O
platelet O
function O
is O
not O
restricted O
to O
hemostasis O
; O
they O
also O
display O
tissue-regenerative O
activities O
. O
here O
, O
we O
review O
evidence O
suggesting O
that O
platelets O
act O
as O
modulators O
of O
opc O
function O
during O
remyelination O
. O
additionally O
, O
we O
describe O
platelet O
alterations O
associated O
with O
ms O
that O
may O
contribute O
to O
remyelination O
failure O
. O
finally O
, O
we O
highlighted O
our O
previous O
study O
that O
addressed O
these O
issues O
. O
this O
study O
showed O
that O
in O
response O
to O
myelin O
damage O
, O
platelets O
transiently O
accumulate O
within O
the O
lesion O
. O
interestingly O
, O
platelet O
depletion O
leads O
to O
a O
reduction O
in O
opc O
differentiation O
, O
hindering O
remyelination O
. O
in O

studies O
revealed O
that O
transient O
exposure O
to O
platelets O
boosts O
opc O
differentiation O
, O
whereas O
sustained O
exposure O
to O
platelets O
suppresses O
this O
beneficial O
effect O
. O
consistent O
with O
this O
observation O
, O
in O
an O
in O
vivo O
model O
of O
thrombocytosis O
( O
calr O
+/-) O
, O
we O
found O
a O
sustained O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
blood-borne O
platelets O
recruited O
into O
the O
cns O
( O
as O

in O
ms O
lesions O
) O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
significant O
decline O
in O
opc O
differentiation O
during O
remyelination O
. O
these O
findings O
reveal O
a O
complex O
role O
of O

in O

and O
provide O
new O
insights O
for O

introduction O
: O
we O
report O
the O
case O
of O
a O
multiple O
drug O
interaction O
involving O
clozapine O
, O
antifungals O
and O
oral O
contraceptives O
, O
which O
resulted O
in O
an O
increased O
clozapine O
plasma O
level O
, O
pericarditis O
with O
pericardial O
effusion O
and O
eosinophilia O
in O
a O
young O
caucasian O
woman O
. O
these O
symptoms O
and O
signs O
disappeared O
a O
few O
days O
after O
discontinuation O
of O
clozapine O
. O
at O
present O
, O
we O
are O
not O
aware O
of O
reports O
of O
clozapine-antifungals O
interaction O
, O
whereas O
there O
is O
only O
one O
other O
case O
report O
on O
the O
interaction O
between O
oral O
contraceptives O
and O
clozapine O
. O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
case O
report O
is O
to O
show O
the O
risk O
of O
potentially O
serious O
adverse O
effects O
stemming O
from O
drug O
interactions O
involving O
medications O
routinely O
used O
in O

. O
case O
presentation O
: O
a O
29-year-old O
caucasian O
woman O
diagnosed O
with O
a O
schizoaffective O
disorder O
was O
admitted O
to O
a O
psychiatric O
unit O
for O
acute O
psychosis O
( O
hallucinations O
, O
delusions O
and O
catatonic O
behavior O
) O
. O
she O
denied O
smoking O
tobacco O
products O
and O
was O
on O
long-term O
oral O
contraceptives O
. O
during O
the O
first O
month O
of O
hospitalization O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
antipsychotics O
and O
for O
1 O
week O
she O
took O
simultaneously O
fluconazole O
and O
miconazole O
gel O
, O
after O
being O
diagnosed O
with O
oral O
candidiasis O
. O
on O
the O
last O
day O
of O
antifungals O
treatment O
, O
29 O
days O
after O
admission O
, O
clozapine O
was O
started O
with O
resolution O
of O
psychotic O
symptoms O
. O
after O
3 O
weeks O
, O
her O
clozapine O
plasma O
level O
had O
increased O
to O
542 O
ng O
/ O
ml O
and O
eosinophilia O
was O
observed O
. O
she O
complained O
of O
nausea O
, O
vomiting B-ADR
and O
palpitations O
; O
echocardiography O
showed O
echocardiographic O
abnormalities O
and O
pericardial O
effusion O
. O
oral O
contraceptives O
were O
discontinued O
and O
after O
1 O
week O
clozapine O
was O
interrupted O
, O
with O
a O
complete O
resolution O
of O
side O
effects O
and O
pericardial O
effusion O
within O
4 O
days O
. O
conclusions O
: O
clozapine O
is O
metabolized O
by O
cytochrome O
p450 O
. O
the O
use O
of O
inhibitors O
or O
other O
substrates O
of O
cytochrome O
p450 O
, O
such O
as O
antifungals O
and O
oral O
contraceptives O
, O
can O
cause O
long-lasting O
interactions O
and O
clozapine O
toxicity O
. O
the O
naranjo O
algorithm O
shows O
clozapine O
is O
a O
definite O
cause O
of O
pericarditis O
( O
score O
9 O
) O
and O
both O
clozapine-antifungals O
and O
clozapine-contraceptives O
interactions O
resulted O
probable O
( O
score O
5 O
) O
in O

a O
good O
knowledge O
on O
drugs O
that O
act O
as O
substrates O
, O
inhibitors O
or O
inducers O
of O
cytochrome O
p450 O
is O
mandatory O
. O
when O
those O
drugs O
are O
used O
in O
patients O
taking O
clozapine O
, O
blood O
level O
monitoring O
of O
clozapine O
should O
be O
recommended O
, O
since O
a O
lower O
dose O
of O
clozapine O
might O

introduction O
since O
the O
last O
edition O
of O
the O
black O
book O
, O
several O
innovative O
agents O
have O
been O
approved O
or O
are O
poised O
to O
be O
approved O
in O
the O
coming O
year O
. O
these O
include O
novel O
antidepressants O
, O
the O
first O
muscarine O
agonist O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
schizophrenia O
, O
the O
first O
psychedelic O
which O
may O
be O
approved O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
ptsd O
( O
post O
traumatic O
stress O
disorder O
) O
, O
and O
the O
first O
disease O
modifying O
drug O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
alzheimer O
's O
disease O
. O
three O
new O
antidepressants O
have O
come O
to O
the O
market O
in O
the O
past O
18 O
months O
. O
the O
first O
of O
those O
, O
auvelity O
, O
the O
combination O
of O
bupropion O
and O
dextromethorphan O
, O
takes O
advantage O
of O
a O
pharmacokinetic O
and O
pharmacodynamic O
synergism O
between O
the O
two O
drugs.85 O
dextromethorphan O
has O
several O
pharmacodynamic O
properties O
including O
actions O
on O
the O
nmda O
receptor O
and O
the O
sigma O
1 O
receptor O
, O
adding O
to O
the O
indirect O
norepinephrine O
agonist O
properties O
of O
bupropion O
. O
how O
dextromethorphan O
is O
rapidly O
metabolized O
via O
the O
cyp2d6 O
isoenzyme O
to O
dextrophan O
that O
may O
have O
mu O
opioid O
agonist O
properties O
. O
the O
combination O
with O
bupropion O
, O
a O
cyp2d6 O
inhibitor O
, O
inhibits O
the O
metabolism O
of O
dextromethorphan O
allowing O
for O
more O
consistent O
therapeutic O
levels O
. O
the O
combination O
of O
dextromethorphan O
45 O
mg O
twice O
per O
day O
and O
bupropion O
sr O
105 O
mg O
twice O
daily O
appears O
to O
be O
more O
effective O
than O
an O
equivalent O
dose O
of O
bupropion O
alone O
both O
in O
speeding O
up O
antidepressant O
response O
and O
achieving O
remission O
. O
however O
, O
it O
's O
not O
clear O
at O
this O
time O
how O
the O
combination O
would O
compare O
with O
a O
more O
typical O
dose O
of O
bupropion O
of O
300-450 O
milligrams O
a O
day O
range O
. O
the O
phase O
iii O
program O
for O
auvelity O
, O
showed O
that O
the O
drug O
was O
well O
tolerated O
with O
the O
most O
common O
side O
effects O
being O
dizziness O
, O
headache O
, O
and O
dry O
mouth.86 O
another O
novel O
antidepressant O
agent O
approved O
in O
2023 O
is O
zuranolone O
( O
zurzuvae O
) O
. O
zuranolone O
is O
an O
oral O
analog O
of O
iv O
brexanalone O
, O
and O
like O
brexanolone O
, O
was O
approved O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
post-partum O
depression.83 O
the O
advantages O
of O
zuranolone O
over O
brexanalone O
are O
many O
. O
while O
brexanolone O
is O
a O
60-hour O
intravenous O
infusion O
that O
must O
be O
administered O
in O
a O
health O
care O
facility O
, O
zuranolone O
is O
a O
once O
/ O
day O
oral O
medication O
that O
is O
usually O
taken O
at O
home O
. O
like O
brexanolone O
, O
and O
unlike O
most O
antidepressants O
, O
zuranolone O
has O
a O
short O
course O
of O
treatment O
, O
lasting O
just O
14 O
days O
. O
zuranolone O
's O
, O
as O
does O
brexanolone O
, O
is O
thought O
to O
act O
primarily O
as O
allosteric O
modulator O
of O
the O
gaba-a O
receptors O
. O
despite O
only O
14 O
days O
of O
treatment O
, O
zuranolone O
produced O
in O
depression O
in O
post-partum O
patients O
a O
clinically O
and O
significantly O
meaningful O
improvement O
at O
day O
15 O
and O
continued O
to O
day O
45 O
or O
1 O
month O
past O
the O
end O
of O
treatment O
. O
zuranolone O
is O
a O
schedule O
iv O
drug O
. O
the O
most O
common O
side O
effect O
in O
clinical O
trials O
was O
somnolence O
with O
36 O
% O
of O
participants O
reporting O
this O
side O
effect O
vs O
only O
6 O
% O
of O
those O
on O
placebo.84 O
other O
common O
side O
effects O
included O
dizziness O
, O
diarrhea O
and O
fatigue O
. O
while O
the O
fda O
declined O
to O
approve O
zuranolone O
as O
monotherapy O
or O
as O
an O
adjunctive O
treatment O
to O
standard O
antidepressants O
in O
major O
depression O
itself O
, O
there O
are O
positive O
studies O
in O
non-post-partum O
major O
depression O
albeit O
with O
smaller O
effect O
sizes O
and O
less O
consistent O
duration O
of O
activity O
. O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
zuranolone O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
studied O
in O
other O
depressive O
syndromes O
such O
as O
depression O
with O
anxious O
distress O
. O
the O
third O
" O
new O
" O
antidepressant O
approved O
late O
2023 O
was O
gepirone O
( O
exxua O
) O
. O
gepirone O
is O
not O
exactly O
a O
new O
or O
novel O
antidepressant O
and O
originally O
sought O
approval O
in O
the O
us O
about O
20 O
years O
ago.88 O
there O
had O
been O
two O
positive O
studies O
of O
gepirone O
during O
the O
original O
nda O
application O
but O
also O
a O
number O
of O
failed O
, O
negative O
, O
or O
non-informative O
studies O
as O
well O
. O
thus O
, O
the O
fda O
declined O
to O
originally O
approve O
the O
drug O
. O
however O
, O
failed O
and O
negative O
trials O
are O
common O
with O
antidepressants O
and O
after O
much O
internal O
debate O
, O
the O
fda O
ultimately O
agreed O
to O
approve O
the O
drug O
based O
on O
the O
positive O
trials O
and O
a O
relatively O
favorable O
side O
effect O
profile O
. O
gepirone O
, O
like O
buspirone O
, O
is O
a O
partial O
agonist O
of O
the O
5ht1a O
receptor O
and O
a O
5ht2 O
antagonist O
. O
as O
such O
, O
gepirone O
does O
not O
tend O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
sexual O
side O
effects O
, O
weight O
gain O
, O
or O
sedation B-ADR
. O
the O
most O
common O
side O
effects O
are O
dizziness O
, O
nausea O
, O
and O
insomnia O
which O
tend O
to O
improve O
in O
many O
patients O
over O
time O
. O
second O
generation O
antipsychotics O
( O
sgas O
) O
continue O
to O
be O
the O
only O
class O
of O
agents O
[ O
other O
than O
esketamine O
( O
spravato O
)] O
approved O
in O
adjunctive O
treatment O
of O
resistant O
major O
depression O
. O
in O
addition O
to O
olanzapine O
( O
combined O
with O
fluoxetine O
; O
symbyax O
) O
, O
aripiprazole O
( O
abilify O
) O
, O
quetiapine O
( O
seroquel O
) O
, O
brexpiprazole O
( O
rexulti O
) O
, O
cariprazine O
( O
vraylar O
) O
became O
the O
latest O
sga O
to O
be O
approved O
in O
2022.90 O
adjunctive O
cariprazine O
at O
1.5 O
mg O
daily O
was O
significantly O
more O
effective O
than O
adjunctive O
placebo O
in O
patients O
with O
mdd O
who O
had O
failed O
to O
achieve O
an O
adequate O
response O
with O
an O
antidepressant O
alone O
after O
6 O
weeks O
of O
treatment O
. O
interestingly O
, O
a O
3 O
mg O
dose O
of O
cariprazine O
was O
less O
consistently O
effective.91 O
the O
major O
advantage O
of O
cariprazine O
over O
some O
of O
the O
other O
approved O
adjunctive O
sga O
's O
is O
easy O
dosing O
, O
with O
the O
starting O
1.5 O
mg O
dose O
being O
the O
optimal O
therapeutic O
dose O
for O
most O
people O
, O
and O
a O
lower O
metabolic O
side O
effect O
burden O
with O
most O
subjects O
having O
limited O
or O
no O
weight O
gain O
in O
short O
term O
trials O
. O
the O
most O
common O
side O
effect O
were O
akathisia O
/ O
restlessness O
, O
fatigue O
, O
and O
nausea O
. O
lumateperone O
( O
caplyta O
) O
is O
also O

positive O
phase O
iii O
data O
in O
the O
adjunctive O
treatment O
of O
major O
depression O
and O
is O
expective O
file O
for O
approval O
in O
late O
2024 O
. O
another O
recent O
major O
development O
in O
psychopharmacology O
is O
the O
reemergence O
of O
psychedelics O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
psychiatric O
disorders O
. O
the O
first O
of O
these O
is O
mdma O
( O
phenethylamine O
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine O
) O
assisted O
psychotherapy O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
ptsd O
. O
a O
new O
drug O
application O
( O

) O
was O
accepted O
by O
the O
fda O
for O
mdma O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
ptsd O
in O
late O
2023.87 O
because O
the O
drug O
is O
being O
fast O
tracked O
as O
a O
" O
breakthrough O
" O
treatment O
by O
the O
fda O
, O
it O
was O
expected O
to O
see O
approval O
in O

the O
phase O
ii O
and O
iii O
data O
for O
mdma O
assisted O
psychotherapy O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O

have O
been O
quite O
consistent O
and O
impressive O
. O
however O
, O
independent O
reviews O
have O
pointed O
to O
significant O
deficiencies O
in O
these O
studies O
including O
the O
bias O
introduced O
because O
of O
functional O
unblinding O
; O
virtually O
all O

can O
guess O
whether O
they O

. O
the O

, O
the O

she O
was O
in O
her O
usual O

until O
after O
her O

. O
this O
was O
the O
first O
presentation O

life O
. O
she O
was O

she O
denied O
any O

, O
inhibits O
the O

. O
the O
combination O

dextromethorphan O
45 O
mg O
twice O

and O
bupropion O
sr O
105 O

appears O
to O
be O
more O
effective O
than O
an O
equivalent O
dose O
of O
bupropion O
alone O
both O
in O
speeding O
up O
antidepressant O
response O
and O
achieving O
remission O
. O
however O
, O
it O
's O
not O
clear O
at O
this O
time O
how O
the O
combination O
would O
compare O
with O
a O
more O
typical O
dose O
of O
bupropion O
of O
300-450 O
milligrams O

another O
novel O
antidepressant O
agent O
approved O
in O

is O
zuranolone O
( O

the O
advantages O
of O
zuranolone O
over O
brexanalone O
are O
many O
. O
while O

is O
a O
60-hour O
intravenous O

antidepressants O
, O
zuranolone O
has O
a O
short O
course O
of O

, O
lasting O
just O
14 O
days O
. O
zuranolone O
's O
, O
as O
does O
brexanolone O
, O
is O
thought O
to O
act O
primarily O
as O
allosteric O
modulator O
of O
the O
gaba-a O
receptors O
. O
despite O
only O
14 O
days O
of O
treatment O
, O
zuranolone O
produced O
in O

in O
post-partum O
patients O
a O
clinically O
and O
significantly O
meaningful O
improvement O
at O
day O
15 O
and O
continued O
to O

past O
the O
end O
of O

the O
most O

the O
third O
" O

gepirone O
is O
not O

originally O
sought O

us O
about O
20 O

there O
had O

also O
a O
number O

. O
thus O
, O
the O
fda O
declined O
to O
originally O
approve O
the O
drug O
. O
however O
, O
failed O
and O
negative O
trials O
are O
common O
with O
antidepressants O
and O
after O
much O
internal O
debate O
, O
the O
fda O
ultimately O
agreed O
to O
approve O
the O
drug O
based O
on O
the O
positive O
trials O
and O
a O
relatively O
favorable O
side O
effect O
profile O
. O
gepirone O
, O
like O

, O
is O
a O
partial O

as O
such O
, O
gepirone O
does O
not O
tend O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
sexual O
side O

, O
or O

. O
the O
most O
common O
side O

the O

the O

the O
phase O

have O
been O
quite O

however O
, O
independent O
reviews O
have O
pointed O
to O
significant O
deficiencies O
in O
these O

the O
bias O
introduced O

of O
functional O
unblinding O
; O
virtually O
all O
patients O

can O
guess O
whether O
they O
got O
the O
active O

. O
the O
functional O
unblinding O
, O
the O
lack O
of O
standardization O
of O
adjunctive O
psychotherapy O
as O
well O
as O
the O
abuse O
potential O
of O
mdma O
, O
may O
delay O
an O
fda O

. O
the O
typical O
regimen O
in O
these O
trials O
included O
3 O
preparatory O
psychotherapy O
sessions O

by O
once O

8 O

there O
were O
typically O
3 O
monthly O
dosing O
sessions O
, O
each O
followed O
by O
3 O
integrative O
psychotherapy O
sessions O
to O
help O
subjects O
process O

understand O
their O
experiences O
during O
the O

in O
the O
most O
recent O
phase O
3 O

, O
over O
70 O
% O

no O

46 O
% O

the O
only O

thus O
, O

to O
achieve O
much O
higher O

since O

that O

an O

be O
made O
that O

since O
the O
introduction O

in O

the O

: O
this O
review O
highlights O
recent O

summary O
: O
cmv O
has O
long O
been O
considered O
an O

background O
: O
coenzyme O
q O
( O
coq O
) O
is O
an O
enzyme O
family O
that O
plays O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
maintaining O
the O
electron O
transport O
chain O
and O
antioxidant O
defense O
. O
coq10 O
is O
the O
most O
common O
form O
of O
coq O
in O
humans O
. O
a O
deficiency O
of O
coq10 O
occurs O
naturally O
with O
aging O
and O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
or O
progression O
of O
many O
diseases O
. O
besides O
, O
certain O
drugs O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
statins O
and O
bisphosphonates O
, O
interfere O
with O
the O
enzymes O
responsible O
for O
coq10 O
biosynthesis O
and O
, O
thus O
, O
lead O
to O
coq10 O
deficiency O
. O
objectives O
: O
this O
article O
aims O
to O
evaluate O
the O
cumulative O
studies O
and O
insights O
on O
the O
topic O
of O
coq10 O
functions O
in O
human O
health O
, O
focusing O
on O
a O
potential O
role O
in O
maintaining O
physical O
activity O
and O
extending O
the O
life O
cycle O
. O
results O
: O
although O
supplementation O
with O
coq10 O
offers O
many O
benefits O
to O
patients O
with O
cardiovascular O
disease O
, O
it O
appears O
to O
add O
little O
value O
to O
patients O
suffering O
from O
statin-associated O
muscular O
symptoms O
. O
this O
may O
be O
attributed O
to O
substantial O
heterogeneity O
in O
doses O
and O
treatment O
regimens O
used O
. O
conclusion O
: O
therefore O
, O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
further O
studies O
involving O
a O
greater O
number O
of O
patients O
to O
clarify O
the O
benefits O
of O
adjuvant O
therapy O
with O
coq10 O
in O
a O
range O
of O
health O
conditions O
and O
diseases O

one O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
challenges O
for O
any O
prescriber O
is O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
legitimate O
prescription O
of O
controlled O
substances O
and O
the O
prescription O
that O
may O
be O
used O
for O
illegitimate O
purposes O
. O
to O
discern O
the O
difference O
, O
prescribers O
need O
to O
understand O
the O
signs O
, O
symptoms O
, O
and O
treatment O
of O
acute O
and O
chronic O
pain O
and O
the O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
of O
patients O
misusing O
controlled O
substances O
. O
pain O
relief O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
reasons O
patients O
seek O
medical O
attention O
. O
although O
many O
categories O
of O
pain O
medications O
are O
available O
, O
opioid O
analgesics O
are O
approved O
by O
the O
food O
and O
drug O
administration O
( O
fda O
) O
for O
moderate-to-severe O
pain O
. O
as O
such O
, O
they O
are O
a O
common O
choice O
for O
patients O
with O
acute O
, O
cancer-related O
, O
neurologic O
, O
and O
end-of-life O
pain O
. O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
for O
chronic O
pain O
is O
controversial O
and O
fraught O
with O
inconclusive O
standards O
. O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
chronic O
failure O
of O
health O
professionals O
to O
treat O
severe O
pain O
appropriately O
led O
to O
an O
expansion O
in O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
. O
unfortunately O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
increased O
overuse O
, O
diversion O
of O
drugs O
, O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
, O
and O
overdose O
. O
the O
catch-22 O
is O
that O
health O
professionals O
either O
undertreat O
patients O
, O
leading O
to O
unnecessary O
suffering O
, O
or O
overtreat O
them O
, O
which O
can O
cause O
adverse O
effects O
such O
as O
increased O
risk O
of O
opioid O
analgesic O
use O
disorder O
and O
potential O
overdose O
. O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
reached O
its O
highest O
point O
in O
2011 O
. O
since O
then O
, O
both O
prescribing O
and O
overdose O
have O
been O
declining O
. O
however O
, O
as O
a O
society O
, O
in O
both O
the O
lay O
and O
scientific O
literature O
, O
there O
are O
significant O
concerns O
that O
we O
are O
still O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
opioid O
crisis O
. O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
challenges O
in O
caring O
for O
patients O
with O
pain O
is O
their O
varying O
tolerance O
levels O
, O
which O
necessitate O
different O
opioid O
doses O
to O
achieve O
adequate O
pain O
relief O
. O
patients O
may O
exhibit O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
behavioral O
, O
cultural O
, O
emotional O
, O
and O
psychological O
responses O
to O
pain O
compared O
to O
those O
with O
a O
substance O
use O
disorder O
; O
often O
, O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
two O
can O
be O
challenging O
. O
all O
healthcare O
professionals O
engaged O
in O
pain O
control O
need O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
treatment O
recommendations O
and O
safety O
concerns O
in O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
. O
appropriate O
opioid O
prescribing O
requires O
a O
thorough O
patient O
assessment O
, O
short O
- O
and O
long-term O
treatment O
planning O
, O
close O
follow-up O
, O
and O
continued O
monitoring O
. O
all O
healthcare O
providers O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
appropriate O
patient O
assessment O
, O
treatment O
planning O
, O
and O
the O
potential O
for O
substance O
use O
disorder O
, O
drug O
diversion O
, O
and O
hazardous O
behavioral O
responses O
to O
controlled O
substances O
, O
such O
as O
opioid O
analgesics O
, O
which O
differ O
from O
pseudoaddiction O
and O
physical O
dependence O
. O
many O
clinicians O
have O
limited O
knowledge O
of O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
. O
they O
often O
fail O
to O
recognize O
it O
as O
a O
disease O
and O
mistakenly O
believe O
that O
opioid O
dependence O
is O
the O
same O
as O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
. O
a O
lack O
of O
clear O
understanding O
can O
lead O
to O
confusion O
between O
patients O
with O
chronic O
non-use O
disorder O
and O
those O
misusing O
their O
prescribed O
opioids O
. O
a O
lack O
of O
training O
and O
educational O
deficits O
often O
interfere O
with O
the O
appropriate O
prescription O
of O
opioid O
analgesic O
agents O
. O
to O
prevent O
the O
misuse O
of O
controlled O
substances O
, O
healthcare O
providers O
who O
prescribe O
controlled O
substances O
should O
learn O
prescribing O
practices O
that O
minimize O
or O
prevent O
adverse O

one O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
challenges O
for O
any O
prescriber O
is O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
legitimate O
prescription O
of O
controlled O
substances O
and O
the O
prescription O
that O
may O
be O
used O
for O
illegitimate O
purposes O
. O
to O
discern O
the O
difference O
, O
prescribers O
need O
to O
understand O
the O
signs O
, O
symptoms O
, O
and O
treatment O
of O
acute O
and O
chronic O
pain O
and O
the O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
of O
patients O
misusing O
controlled O
substances O
. O
pain O
relief O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
most O
common O
reasons O
patients O
seek O
medical O
attention O
. O
although O
many O
categories O
of O
pain O
medications O
are O
available O
, O
opioid O
analgesics O
are O
approved O
by O
the O
food O
and O
drug O
administration O
( O
fda O
) O
for O
moderate-to-severe O
pain O
. O
as O
such O
, O
they O
are O
a O
common O
choice O
for O
patients O
with O
acute O
, O
cancer-related O
, O
neurologic O
, O
and O
end-of-life O
pain O
. O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
for O
chronic O
pain O
is O
controversial O
and O
fraught O
with O
inconclusive O
standards O
. O
in O
the O
1990s O
, O
the O
chronic O
failure O
of O
health O
professionals O
to O
treat O
severe O
pain O
appropriately O
led O
to O
an O
expansion O
in O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
. O
unfortunately O
, O
this O
resulted O
in O
increased O
overuse O
, O
diversion O
of O
drugs O
, O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
, O
and O
overdose O
. O
the O
catch-22 O
is O
that O
health O
professionals O
either O
undertreat O
patients O
, O
leading O
to O
unnecessary O
suffering O
, O
or O
overtreat O
them O
, O
which O
can O
cause O
adverse O
effects O
such O
as O
increased O
risk O
of O
opioid O
analgesic O
use O
disorder O
and O
potential O
overdose O
. O
opioid O
analgesic O
prescribing O
reached O
its O
highest O
point O
in O
2011 O
. O
since O
then O
, O
both O
prescribing O
and O
overdose O
have O
been O
declining O
. O
however O
, O
as O
a O
society O
, O
in O
both O
the O
lay O
and O
scientific O
literature O
, O
there O
are O
significant O
concerns O
that O
we O
are O
still O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
an O
opioid O
crisis O
. O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
challenges O
in O
caring O
for O
patients O
with O
pain O
is O
their O
varying O
tolerance O
levels O
, O
which O
necessitate O
different O
opioid O
doses O
to O
achieve O
adequate O
pain O
relief O
. O
patients O
may O
exhibit O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
behavioral O
, O
cultural O
, O
emotional O
, O
and O
psychological O
responses O
to O
pain O
compared O
to O
those O
with O
a O
substance O
use O
disorder O
; O
often O
, O
distinguishing O
between O
the O
two O
can O
be O
challenging O
. O
all O
healthcare O
professionals O
engaged O
in O
pain O
control O
need O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
treatment O
recommendations O
and O
safety O
concerns O
in O
prescribing O
opioid O
analgesics O
. O
appropriate O
opioid O
prescribing O
requires O
a O
thorough O
patient O
assessment O
, O
short O
- O
and O
long-term O
treatment O
planning O
, O
close O
follow-up O
, O
and O
continued O
monitoring O
. O
all O
healthcare O
providers O
need O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
appropriate O
patient O
assessment O
, O
treatment O
planning O
, O
and O
the O
potential O
for O
substance O
use O

, O

diversion O
, O
and O
hazardous O
behavioral O
responses O
to O
controlled O
substances O
, O
such O
as O
opioid O
analgesics O
, O
which O
differ O
from O
pseudoaddiction O
and O
physical O
dependence O
. O
many O
clinicians O
have O
limited O
knowledge O
of O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
. O
they O
often O
fail O
to O
recognize O
it O
as O
a O
disease O
and O
mistakenly O
believe O
that O
opioid O
dependence O
is O
the O
same O
as O
opioid O
use O
disorder O
. O
a O
lack O
of O
clear O
understanding O
can O
lead O
to O
confusion O
between O
patients O
with O
chronic O
non-use O
disorder O
and O
those O
misusing O
their O
prescribed O
opioids O
. O
a O
lack O
of O
training O
and O
educational O
deficits O
often O
interfere O
with O
the O
appropriate O

agents O
. O
to O
prevent O
the O

of O
